[**Working demo**](https://image-uploader-dev-challenge.netlify.app/ "Working demo")

This application was created as a submission to the [full-stack](https://devchallenges.io/paths/full-stack-developer) series challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/O2iGT9yBd6xZBrOcVirx) was to build an application that allows users to upload images and get the url.

The main goal making this challenge was to learn how to make both front-end and back-end. This repo consists of two folders: server and client. 

The server-side was built with Express and the client with React.
